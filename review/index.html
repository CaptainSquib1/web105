    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>During the game you have the ability to double jump, flip, and boost.
      These different abilities allow you to hit the ball in different ways.
      It can be played on a basic level with the basic jumps and flips however,
      more advanced players can use these abilities to fly into the air and accurately
      hit the ball into the goal. There are a variety of different techniques for the different
      movement abilities. The boost ability starts at 30% and can be refilled using boost pads found
      around the game map. It can be used to hit the ball with more force, fly into the air to intercept a high
      flying ball or to get to the other side of the court faster. The most common game mode can be played solo or with teams 
      of 2 to 4 players. Each match has a 5 minute timer and the team with the most goals at the end of the timer wins. There is an
      overtime period if the score is tied at the end of the timer.

    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <p> Rocket League is a very fun game to play with friends. There is a chatting system that allows you to talk to your teammates
      throughout the game. It is a very competitive game and can be very frustrating at times. It is very faced paced with the only breaks
      being when the ball goes into one of the goals. As IGN, a game reviewer, put it,  
      <q
        ><em>Rocket League is a hyper-powered, arena-based, futuristic vehicle
        sports game that will test your driving and stunting skills like never
        before.</em></q
      > You can play for hours on end and not get bored. You could even spend hours customizing your car with the many different options available.
      With the different game modes and simple controls it is a game that both the casual and competitive player can enjoy.
