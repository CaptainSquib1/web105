    <h1>Frank's Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am taking this class for my programming certification. 
        I am also taking it because I want to be able to create my 
        own website. I also have an interest in programming.</p>

    <p>Last year I bought a Canon T7 Camera. I like spending time outside and taking pictures of nature 
        and animals. I have been experimenting with the different 
        settings on the camera in order to be better at taking 
        photos in a variety of light levels.</p>
