            <p>Crabs are fascinating crustaceans that are commonly found in the marine environment. They come in various sizes and colors, and their distinctive sideways movement is a trademark feature. Crabs have a hard exoskeleton that protects their body and helps prevent water loss.

                One unique aspect of crabs is their ability to regenerate limbs. If they lose a leg in a fight or an accident, they can regrow it over time. Crabs are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. They scavenge for food on the ocean floor and are known for their strong pincers.
                
                Crabs have adapted to various marine habitats, from sandy beaches to rocky tide pools. Some species, like the hermit crab, live in empty shells, while others, like the fiddler crab, have one large claw they use for communication and digging burrows.
                
                Marine biologists study crabs to better understand their role in marine ecosystems and how environmental changes can impact their populations.

            Crabs exhibit a remarkable diversity of adaptations. Some crabs, like the coconut crab, are terrestrial and can climb trees to retrieve coconuts. Others, like the decorator crab, adorn their shells with bits of seaweed and debris as camouflage. Crabs also have specialized behaviors for reproduction. For example, male fiddler crabs use their large claws to perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females, showcasing the fascinating variety within this group of crustaceans.
