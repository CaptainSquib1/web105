            <p>Whales are majestic marine mammals that capture our imagination with their immense size and graceful movements. They are some of the largest creatures on Earth. There are two main types of whales: toothed whales and baleen whales.

                Toothed whales, like dolphins and orcas, have sharp teeth and are carnivorous. They hunt fish, squid, and other marine animals. Baleen whales, such as humpback and blue whales, have baleen plates instead of teeth and filter small organisms like krill from the water.
                
                Whales are known for their impressive migrations. Some species travel thousands of miles to reach their feeding and breeding grounds. They communicate using a variety of sounds, from songs that can travel long distances to clicks and whistles.
                
                Despite their massive size, whales are vulnerable to threats such as pollution, ship strikes, and entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation efforts are critical to protect these incredible animals and their habitats.

            Whales are renowned for their intelligence and complex social structures. They are known to communicate through a range of vocalizations and have even been observed working together in coordinated hunting strategies. Baleen whales, in particular, are crucial for maintaining the health of marine ecosystems. They help control the population of prey species like krill, preventing overpopulation and promoting the balance of the food web.
